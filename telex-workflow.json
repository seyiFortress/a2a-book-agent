  "long_description": "The Public Domain Book Extractor is an A2A-enabled agent that searches for and extracts excerpts from public domain books available through Project Gutenberg. Simply provide a search query for a book, author, or topic, and the agent will find relevant public domain works and provide you with a sample excerpt. This agent is perfect for discovering classic literature, researching historical texts, or finding quotes from famous authors whose works are in the public domain. The agent uses the Gutendex API to search for books and then retrieves the full text to provide meaningful excerpts. All content returned is from public domain works, making it safe to use for educational purposes, research, or creative projects.",
